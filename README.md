# radialMenu

To install download the nodegraphhooks.py file and put it in the python2.7libs directory in your houdini home dir (ie $HOUDINI_PATH). The python2.7libs dir may need to be created if it doesn't already exist. If you already have a nodegraphhooks.py file it's contents will need to be manually merged with this one.

See here for more info about this directory https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/locations.html#disk

The nodes available in the menu for each context and the menu hotkey can be customized in the createEventHandler function at the top of the script.
